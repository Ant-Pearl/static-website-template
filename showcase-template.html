        Creating this template website has been my way of taking my knowledge from the information I’ve gathered online and learning how to apply it into a real world situation. Most aspects of HTML and CSS are quite simple, so I will limit this page to the more interesting aspects of building this site such as layout choices, CSS interactions, and JavaScript.

      <div class="qs-main-container boxed-div">
        <span class="qs-selector">Layout Choices</span>
        <span class="qs-selector">CSS Utilization</span>
        <span class="qs-selector">JavaScript</span>
      </div>

      <h2 class="section-header-small">Layout Choices</h2>
      <div class="product-page-info">
        After deciding the purpose of my website, determining who will be visiting my website and getting into their mindset is a necessary step in making good design choices. People looking to hire me would want to know about my experience and attitude right away without having to spend time finding it. A customer visiting a restaurant would want to know what the food looks like and what makes it desirable. For both of these cases, the visitor should at least want to know who I am, what I do, what my experience is, and where they can get more information. It’s important that everything is designed efficiently; big pictures and descriptive words are great ways to allow a viewer to effortlessly absorb the right information for a proper first impression. If the visitor decides they do want more information, simplicity and organization is key. It is important not to overwhelm the visitor with too many choices. For my version of the website I only have the showcase and about page displayed on the header. About is short and sweet, however showcase requires proper grouping and ordering.

      <h2 class="section-header-small">CSS Variables</h2>

        <img class="zoomable-image product-page-image" src="Images/Template-Showcase/CSS-variables.png" alt="">
        <div class="product-page-info">
          Graphic design can be difficult especially with my inexperience, so I decided to organize the CSS file so that most of the website colors can be easily changed through CSS variables at the top of my CSS file. This way I can find color themes online and easily test and organize them for quick trial and error.
